# CHARIoT Challenge: Wildfire Scenario

## Scenario Narrative

Last Friday, a wildfire started in the mountains above Misfortuneville, U.S.A. Firefighters suspect the fire originated at a camp site located off of I-70. 

Today at 8:00 AM, although the fire continues to burn in remote areas, firefighters have made significant progress in recent days, containing approximately 75-80% of the fire aided by unexpected rain showers and calmer winds. Evacuation orders have been lifted for Misfortuneville, U.S.A., but hundreds of people remain in shelters, awaiting permission to return to their homes. Local law enforcement has restricted access to heavily damaged areas and established a curfew in some portions of the community to prevent looting. Power remains out in several major residential areas. 

Firefighters are tasked with assessing assets still at risk, identifying the burn areas, and containing the rest of the fire before it has a chance to spread to other cities and towns. An air tanker is seeking information to drop water and fire retardant onto areas of the wildfire. The job of the firefighters is to eliminate three areas where the fire is at its most intense levels to prevent further damage.
