# CHARIoT Challenge: Flood Scenario

## Scenario Narrative

Misfortuneville, U.S.A.  has a state-of-the-art emergency preparedness/response center, and the city itself has been outfitted with the newest sensors to keep its residents safe. None of that’s important right now. This morning, the National Weather Service reported strong storms in the area during the afternoon, and alerted residents to stay alert for flash flooding.

At 2:00 PM, the rain began at a rate of 3” per hour and was projected to move along within the hour. Being flood prone, the city is equipped with flood water level sensors in low lying areas. These sensors were activated at 2:30 PM and showed 4” of standing water already. This information was electronically distributed to emergency dispatch maps for use in communication.

At 3:00 PM, the National Weather Service indicated that although the storm had been originally indicated to exit the area in a short period of time, the storm had stalled, and rain could be expected to continue over Misfortuneville, U.S.A. for the next few hours. The original flood watch was upped to a flood warning.

At 3:30 PM, the city established its emergency flood response center in preparation for a prolonged rain event. The emergency flood response center personnel included the city emergency manager, public works manager, and dispatch personnel. Both the city officials and the dispatch personnel have access to a situational awareness platform showing the state of the city at the current time or a projected time in the future. This platform was also available to incident command and apparatus at localized incidents.
