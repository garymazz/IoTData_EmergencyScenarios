# CHARIoT Challenge: Mass Transit Accident Scenario

## Scenario Narrative

There is a train derailment with associated fire and smoke. Passengers call 911 and report the incident. Sensors on the tracks locate where the derailment occurred and nature of the cars (e.g., on/off tracks). CCTV security cameras inside tunnel show real-time footage of the smoke from the trains. Sensors on the cars indicate number of passengers in each car and status of the doors and emergency exits. Additional sensors in the tunnel share smoke levels, temperature, CO2, emergency lighting, and status of the rail (3rd Rail) that is electrified.

Additional sensors are available in the station including environmental sensors indicating smoke and CO2 entering. Firefighters respond to the area at the next station up and are able to load a fire suppression unit on the tracks to respond to the fire. Responders travel down the tracks and locate the front carâ€¯ of the train. Various communications occur throughout the event. Responders attack the fire and then proceed to open up the side doors and evacuate the passengers inside.  

Due to heavy smoke, responders could not see the train in the tunnel until they were right next to it. Radio communication was sporadic in the subway stations and tunnels. The side door of the train required special keys and would not open for passengers. One person on the train was found unconscious. The following were dispatched: 

* 5 Engine Companies
* 2 Ladder Trucks
* 2 Battalion Fire Chiefs
* 1 Battalion Fire Chief to Operations Command Center 
* 1 Heavy Rescue Squad
* 1 Basic Life Support Unit
* 1 Advanced Life Support Unit
* 1 Emergency Medical Services Supervisor

Passengers and pedestrians near the subway station were evacuated. Rescue personnel estimate that the evacuation was completed by 16:25.
