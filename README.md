# IoT Data: Emergency Scenarios Repository 

The NIST IoT Data:  Emergency Scenarios data repository is an online venue open to the public where interested parties can access emulated IoT data related to four specific emergency scenarios.  This data demonstrates situational awareness information that would be provided to a first responder or an incident commander during a mission critical event.

## Scenarios

* **Active Shooter:**  The active shooter scenario portrays a shooting incident within an office complex.  Law Enforcement officers are the primary first responder types targeted for the data provided.

* **Flood:**  The flood scenario demonstrates a large scale heavy rain event with corresponding emergency response throughout the city.  Fire Service, Emergency Medical Service and Law Enforcement personnel all can utilize the data provided within the scenario.

* **Mass Transit Accident:**  The mass transit accident scenario portrays a train derailment and associated fire.  The train cars are in various states of accessibility, and the tunnel where the crash occurs further limits the visibility of the first responders.  Emergency Medical Service and Fire Service personnel would be the primary users of this data.

* **Wildfire:**  The wildfire scenario demonstrates a large-scale burn event beginning in remote areas and spreading to more populated areas.  Fire Service and Emergency Medical Service personnel are the primary first responder types targeted for the data provided.

Within the folder for each scenario, an additional README file will provide additional details regarding the scenario, as well as the data provided.

## Contribute to the Space 

Contributions come in three categories:

1. **Tool:** A tool can be an open source solution or process, ranging from software to frameworks. 
2. **Use Case:** A use case is an example of an organization processing data about individuals for some explicit purpose(s) (e.g., where a goal is to prevent re-identification of the data during its processing, improve privacy risk assessment practices).
3. **Feedback:** Help the community. Provide feedback on tools and use cases.

Tools and use cases are contributed via pull requests, while feedback is contributed via issues. Contributed tools and use cases can be hosted directly in this repository, or you can host them elsewhere online and link to them from this repository.

### How to Contribute Tools and Use Cases  (Not sure if we want this section)

1. Fork a copy of USNISTGOV/PrivacyEngCollabSpace to your own organizational or personal space. 

2. Create a branch in your fork, named specifically for your contribution. 

3. In your branch: 

	A. Create a new directory within the relevant tool or use case directory: tools/de-identification, tools/risk-assessment, use-cases/de-identification, or use-cases/risk-assessment. Example: *tools/de-identification/[your-contribution-name]*

	B. Name the directory to describe your contribution. 

	C. Include in the directory a README.md file that follows the relevant [template](https://github.com/usnistgov/PrivacyEngCollabSpace/tree/master/templates). There is a template for a [tool](https://github.com/usnistgov/PrivacyEngCollabSpace/tree/master/templates/tool-template.md) and for a [use case](https://github.com/usnistgov/PrivacyEngCollabSpace/tree/master/templates/use-case-template.md) contribution.

	D. If hosting a tool in this repository, also include in the directory any pertinent source code files or documentation. 

	E. Update the README.md file of the main directory to which you’re contributing. This README provides an index of that directory's contents. It should include an entry reflecting your contribution. 

5. Create a [pull request](https://github.com/usnistgov/PrivacyEngCollabSpace/pull/new/master) (PR) from your branch to the master branch in USNISTGOV/PrivacyEngCollabSpace. 

6. Moderators will then review the PR and may provide comments and suggestions to the contributor. 

### How to Contribute Feedback 

Submit an [issue](https://github.com/usnistgov/IoTData_EmergencyScenarios/issues/new) to provide feedback on tools or use cases in the space. Please select appropriate tags related to the feedback.

## Operating Rules 

NIST will only accept open source submissions, per the Open Source Initiative’s [definition](https://opensource.org/osd) of “open source”. Upon submission, materials will be public, considered to be open source, and may be altered and shared. 

This is a moderated platform. NIST reserves the right to reject, remove, or edit any submission, including anything that: 

* promotes pay-for services or products;  
* includes personally identifiable or business identifiable information according to Department of Commerce Office of Privacy and Open Government [guidelines](http://www.osec.doc.gov/opog/privacy/PII_BII.html); 
* is inaccurate;  
* contains abusive or vulgar content, spam, hate speech, personal attacks, or similar content;
* is clearly "off topic"; 
* makes unsupported accusations; or, 
* contains .exe or .jar file types.* 

*These file types will not be merged into the NIST repository; instead, NIST may link to these if hosted elsewhere.
