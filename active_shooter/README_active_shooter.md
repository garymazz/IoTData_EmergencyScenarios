# CHARIoT Challenge: Active Shooter Scenario

## Scenario Narrative

At approximately 9:30 AM an employee notices a masked individual entering her office complex.  The masked individual is carrying a large black bag and wearing a long trench coat. The employee thought this was odd and begins to walk away, grabbing her cell phone to notify the police.

Upon picking up her cell phone, the employee begins hearing gunfire. The masked shooter has entered the reception area and has opened fire on multiple employees.
The receptionist who was on the phone, was the first person killed. The masked shooter begins to look for more employees to shoot.

Thirty to forty people work in the office. Doors are being slammed shut, and the sounds of people yelling could be heard throughout the entire office space.

9:57 AM a 911 operator reported receives the following call:

* **Caller: Someone is shooting. I’ve heard five or six shots. People are screaming. There’s another shot.**
* **Operator: What is your location?**
* **Caller: The Misfortuneville Office Complex.**
* **Operator: Who is shooting?**
* **Caller: A masked man.**
* **Operator: Where inside the complex is the shooting?**
* **Caller: On the third floor in the Financial Center.**
* **Operator: Where are you?**
* **Caller: I am hiding in my office.**
* **Operator: Can you see the shooter?**
* **Caller: No.**

At 10:15 AM, approximately ten police department patrol cars arrive on the scene. The dispatcher indicates all recent calls are reporting a shooting inside the Financial Center, on the third floor, but no additional details.

Two officers are positioned next to the main company elevator when the elevator doors open. People rush out the doors. Additional police officers enter the building and are heading to the elevators and emergency stairwells.
